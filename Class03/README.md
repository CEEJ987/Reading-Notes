## Importance

 This is important because I want to learn how to use Git, since it will be useful in my career.

# Notes

**Version control** is being able to go back to past versions of programs in order to fix things or revert.

Local Version Control is the same way, just local
**Centralized Version Control** is the collaboration between others where all versions are stored on a server database.
**Distributed Version Control** is a mirrored repo, a backup, which can be implemented into the CVS to update it if needed. (Offline)

## Git
**Git** is a DVS, which stores files in data as snapshots, once changes are made you can **commit**

Git mostly relies on local operaitons, allowing offline work be more collaborative
Tracks every change
Helps prevent loss of data

### Stages of Git

**Committed** - Securely stored in local database
**Modified** - File has been edited, just not sent
**Staged** - File has been sent to be changed in the next version

## Making a Git

Making a git can be done from terminal

# **Git Commands**

git init (creates git repo)
git clone (Clones a repo)
git status (Status of current repo)
git add filename (tracks only one file) (File will be tracked and staged)
git add * (tracks all file names) (files will be tracked and staged)
git commit -m "yatayata"(commits your work, leaves message for file)
git commit -a (commits all)
git push origin master (pushes code to one copy of repo to the other)
git stash (hides all changes, clean slate)
git stash apply (comes back)

**When cloning repos, Git will give the original repo the name origin, and your copy is becoming the master**

## Things I want to know!

I want to learn how to fully master git, not using github desktop in order to commit
I want to practice my uses of git.
