## [Lab 01 Assignment](https://connerkt.github.io/Reading-Notes/Class01/Lab01)

## Github

So in class we learned about making repo's in Github, and how to deploy a page for that repo. I learned how to use markdown to-
create different forms of text for my repo.

## [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#overview/)

Different syntax in Markdown allow you to perform cool things such as forming a website!

## Headings

So for syntax in markdown I learned how to use "#'s" to form headings.
These headings get smaller with the more you use!

### Using Emphasis

In markdown you can do things such as bold and italic

**Bold** is done with two **.

*Italic* is done with one *.

Bold and Italic is done with three ***.

***See!***.

(Remember to use the *** before and after!).

(Also remember that you can use "_" instad of "*", but its up to you!!!
