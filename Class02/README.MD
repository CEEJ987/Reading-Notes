# Class 2 Notes

This topic matters for this module because it helps us navigate our computer with more ease, being able to do things really fast.
This can be creating files, moving them, and removing them.
It can also speed up the process of opening programs, making automation possible.

## [Lab 2 Assignment](https://connerkt.github.io/Reading-Notes/Class02/Lab02)

## The Command Line

Using the Terminal is a text based interface that allows you to use it to execute code to the computer
Its a simple form of an text editor
Adding, Deleting, and Moving Directories

You start by issuing a command like ls and using a command argument to specify
The first command line argument is called an option
An option modifies the behavior of a command
(Usually starts with a -)

## Bash

Within the terminal is a shell, which defines how your terminal behaves
**Bash** is the most popular (Mac comes with zsch)

## Navigation

**pwd** - prints current dir
**ls** - tells whats in the current dir
(ls can be used more powerfully)
***ls (options) (location)***

A **path** is the means to get to a particular directory or file

The Two different types of Paths : **Absolute** and **Relative**

A **Relative Path** is the location of a file relative to its current directory
A **Absolute Path** describes the locaiton from the root directory

## Useful Navigation Commands
**~** is used as a shortcut to your home directory
**.** is used to reference your current directory
**..** is used to to reference the parent directory
(.. can be used to keep returning to the root directory)

**cd** allows you to move in directories
(Tip: Pressing Tab while typing a command can auto complete it for you!)

## Information about Files

Extensions are what comes after file names, for most OS, its important (When using programming languages)
Linux looks inside the file :eyes:

**file** is a command to use to find out what type of file it is 

Linux is **CASE** sensitive

Spaces in names can be found if using certain methods:
1. Quoting ('')
2. Escape characters (\)
(If a file starts with a ., it means its a hidden file)

## Things I want to know more about

I want to explore more of the opening program side of command lines
How do I automate this?
