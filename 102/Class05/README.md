**CSS** is the styling of web pages. 

**HTML** is like the structure of a webpage, ugly and basic, but CSS adds *Style*

Lets be honest, HTML is boring!
### CSS is the presentation of a document, how its styled and laid out.

### Documents are text files like HTML, SVG, XML.

## Uses of CSS

### Changing Color and size of headings and links!

### Animation

### Turning a column for example into a layout

## **Syntax for CSS**

### **CSS** is a rule based language, you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to specific elements on your web page.

###  Specify a Selector (h1,p, div, body, etc)

### Use curly braces to hold your declarations

Ex.
h1 {  (Where declarations are made)
    color: red; (your property is color, your value is red)
    font-size: 5em; (your property is font-size, value is 5em)
}

### Theres two declarations here, for font size and color

### Its the deeper details of the language in order to have consistent support over the years and not breaking old sites.
