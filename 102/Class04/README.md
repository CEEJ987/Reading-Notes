# Wireframes

**Wireframing** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

- How they want to process info on a site

When designing its there to show you where you might want things to go before coding said site.

A good way to know how a user uses your site, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagram.

Either can be drawn by hand, or some use software such as **Invision** and **Balsamiq**.

Paper drawn - easier to change and more flexible.

Software drawn - More detail orientated.
